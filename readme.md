Project Architecture
Backend: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend
AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is used to run the serverless functions that handle API requests. These functions read and write data to DynamoDB and S3.

API Gateway
API Gateway is used to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure the RESTful APIs. It serves as the entry point for the Lambda functions.

DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is used to store user data.

S3
Amazon S3 is used for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. In this project, S3 is used to store uploaded images.

Frontend
React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The frontend of this project is built using React.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is used for styling the React components.

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/backend
Install Dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Deploy the Backend:

Make sure your AWS CLI is configured with the correct credentials. Deploy the backend using the Serverless Framework:

sh
Copy code
serverless deploy
Update API Gateway Endpoint in Frontend:

After deployment, note down the API Gateway endpoint and update it in the frontend code.

Frontend Setup
